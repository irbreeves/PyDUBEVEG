# PyDUBEVEG
Python version of the DUBEVEG (DUne, BEach, and VEGetation) model from Keijsers et al. (2016) and Galiforni Silva et al. (2018, 2019)

Warning: this is a nearly identical translation of the original MATLAB version from Silva et al. (2019) and therefore includes any bugs found in original MATLAB version.
